        <h3>New Year</h3>
        <p>Many Filipino people unite on New Year’s Eve, which is on December 31, to celebrate a midnight meal known as the Media Noche. It is also common to stay awake to greet the coming of the New Year. New Year’s Day is also characterized by Filipinos lighting fireworks and making a lot of noise to drive away evil spirits. This belief originated from the Chinese.</p>
        <p>The elderly encourage children to jump at the stroke of midnight so that they would grow up tall. Many people display 12 circular fruits and wear clothing with polka dots to symbolize money. It is also popular practice to open all the doors and windows at the stroke of midnight to let in the good luck. Many Filipino families also read the Christian bible and attend a church midnight mass. It is common for many Filipinos to blend religion and superstition in celebrating New Year’s Day.</p>
        <p>The New Year’s Day/New Year’s Eve celebrations start on December 31 and continue through to January 1. New Year’s Day in the Philippines is short but uniquely celebrated throughout the country. This is also the time of the year when many Filipino families get together and strengthen their family ties. New Year’s Day in the Philippines is a joyful holiday that is characterized with the intermarriage of religion and paganism which are the attributes of a once Hispanic Philippine Society.</p>
        <p>Filipinos symbolize New Year’s Day with their visions of how the start of the New Year opens opportunities for a bountiful life.</p>

        <h3>Eidul-Fitar</h3>
        <p>Eidul-Fitar is a public holiday. It is a day off for the general population, and schools and most businesses are closed.</p>
        <p>For Muslims around the world, Eid ul Fitr marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting and prayer. It is one of the largest and most important celebrations in the Islamic calendar.</p>

        <p>Eid ul Fitr falls on the first day of Shawwal, the 10th month of the Islamic calendar. Since Muslims follow a lunar calendar, where a year is approximately 11 days shorter than a solar year, Eid falls on an earlier date in the western Gregorian calendar each year. A new month in the Muslim calendar begins when the Waxing Crescent Moon becomes visible after the New Moon phase. An authorized committee has to confirm the Moon sighting. While Eid ul Fitr itself lasts only one day, the day following the holy month of Ramadan, it is also celebrated in the days that follow in some countries and Muslim communities. Festivities can last for up to three days.</p>
